# Open Science Tools

## Tools of Open Science

Open science tools are any resources or instruments that support your research through:
- Data storage and discovery
- Code collaboration and version control
- Persistent identification
- Documentation and communication
- Community engagement

## Repositories: Storing Data and Code

### What is a Repository?

A repository is a digital storage system that:
- Stores research data or software
- Provides access and discoverability
- Ensures long-term preservation
- Often includes version control features

### Repository vs. Archive

**Repository**
- Often uses version control systems (Git, Mercurial, Subversion)
- Enables collaborative development
- Tracks changes and versions
- Examples: GitHub, GitLab, institutional repositories

**Archive**
- Permanent storage of final versions
- No ongoing development
- Ensures long-term preservation
- Examples: Zenodo, institutional archives

## Example Repositories for Data and Software

### Data Repositories

- **Zenodo** - Multidisciplinary data and software archiving
- **Figshare** - Shareable datasets, presentations, and papers
- **DataVerse** - Institutional data repositories
- **Open Science Framework (OSF)** - Project management and data sharing
- **Harvard Dataverse** - Institutional repository for research data

### Discipline-Specific Repositories

- **GenBank** - Genetic sequences
- **Protein Data Bank** - 3D protein structures
- **NOAA** - Climate and environmental data
- **Dryad** - Data associated with publications

### Software Repositories

- **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration
- **GitLab** - Alternative to GitHub with institutional options
- **PyPI** - Python packages
- **CRAN** - R packages
- **Zenodo** - Long-term preservation of research software

## Version Control: Tracking Changes

### What is Version Control?

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to:
- Code and software
- Documentation
- Configuration files
- Research outputs

### Benefits of Version Control

- **Track history** - See who made what changes and when
- **Collaboration** - Multiple people can work on same project
- **Revert changes** - Go back to previous versions
- **Branching** - Explore alternative approaches
- **Integration** - Combine work from multiple developers

## Types of Software Version Control

### Centralized Version Control
- Single central repository
- All changes go to one location
- Examples: Subversion (SVN), Perforce
- Advantages: Simple, clear authority
- Disadvantages: Single point of failure

### Distributed Version Control
- Every developer has a complete copy
- Changes can be tracked locally
- Examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar
- Advantages: Redundancy, offline capability
- Disadvantages: More complex

## Version Control Platforms

Version control platforms expand the usefulness of version control by:
- Providing centralized storage
- Enabling collaboration features
- Hosting documentation
- Managing access controls
- Facilitating issue tracking

### Popular Platforms

**GitHub**
- Built on Git
- Large community of developers
- Extensive CI/CD integration
- Free public repositories
- Wide adoption in open science

**GitLab**
- Similar to GitHub
- Strong institutional support
- Self-hosting options
- More enterprise features

**Bitbucket**
- Supports Git and Mercurial
- Good for private repositories
- Jira integration

## Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)

### What is a Persistent Identifier?

A persistent identifier (PID) is a long-lasting reference to a digital resource that:
- Remains valid over time
- Points to the same resource across locations
- Enables reliable citation
- Supports data discovery

### Types of Persistent Identifiers

**DOI (Digital Object Identifier)**
- Standard for academic research
- Managed by CrossRef, DataCite
- Example: 10.5281/zenodo.1234567
- Supports: Articles, datasets, software

**ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID)**
- Unique identifier for researchers
- Distinguishes between similar names
- Links all your publications and contributions
- Free to obtain

**ARK (Archival Resource Key)**
- Provides persistent access
- Often used for institutional repositories
- Less commercial than DOI

**Handle System**
- Protocol and system for PID resolution
- Foundation for DOI system
- Distributed infrastructure

### Benefits of Using PIDs

- **Discoverability** - Others can find your work reliably
- **Citation** - Enables accurate attribution
- **Tracking** - Monitor impact and reuse
- **Accessibility** - Persistent links remain valid
- **Integration** - Works across platforms and services

## Additional Open Science Tools

### Documentation and Collaboration

- **Overleaf** - Collaborative LaTeX writing
- **Google Docs** - Cloud-based document collaboration
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - Executable research documents
- **OSF** - Project management and collaboration

### Communication and Sharing

- **Preprint servers** - arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv
- **Open Science Framework** - Workflows and transparency
- **Slack/Discord** - Research team communication

### Data Management

- **Data Stewardship Wizard** - Data management planning
- **DMPTool** - Institutional DMP support

## Key Takeaways

- Use repositories to store and preserve data and code
- Implement version control for tracking changes and collaboration
- Assign persistent identifiers (DOI, ORCID) to enable reliable discovery and citation
- Choose tools appropriate for your research community
- Proper tool selection supports reproducibility and research impact
