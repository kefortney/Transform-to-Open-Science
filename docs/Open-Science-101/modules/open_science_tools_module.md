## Lesson 1: Repositories and Data Storage

### Overview
In this lesson, you explore the different types of repositories used to store and preserve research data and software, understand the differences between development repositories and archives, and learn how to select appropriate platforms for your research outputs.

### 1.1 What is a Repository?

A repository is a digital storage system that keeps research data, code, and documentation organized and accessible. It provides a stable home for your outputs, makes them discoverable through search and indexing, and preserves them for long-term use so others can return to the work years later. Repositories also support versioning, which means changes can be tracked over time and specific releases can be referenced when results are cited or reused.

At its core, a repository delivers five essential services. It offers **storage** through secure and reliable hosting, **access** through public or restricted permissions, and **preservation** by maintaining files and migrating formats as needed. It also supplies **metadata** that describes what the content is and how to use it, and **persistence** by assigning identifiers such as DOIs so the work can always be found and cited.

### 1.2 Repository vs. Archive: Key Differences

| Development Repositories | Archives (Data Preservation) |
|---|---|
| **Purpose:** Active collaborative development | **Purpose:** Long-term preservation of final versions |
| **Version Control:** Full Git/Mercurial/SVN integration | **Version Control:** Minimal (snapshot preservation) |
| **History:** Complete change tracking | **History:** Limited to deposited versions |
| **Branching:** Experimental and parallel work | **Immutability:** Final versions cannot be changed |
| **Examples:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket | **Examples:** Zenodo, Figshare, Dataverse |
| **Use When:** Actively writing code, multiple developers, rapid iterations | **Use When:** Publishing final datasets, archiving software releases, preservation required |

**Best Practice:** Use both together
```
Active Development → GitHub/GitLab → Release → Zenodo/Archive
     (versions)     (collaboration)      (final)  (preservation)
```

### 1.4 Discipline-Specific Repositories

Discipline-specific repositories matter because they use field-appropriate metadata standards, align with community practices, and provide discovery tools tailored to how your field searches for data. They also prioritize long-term preservation and help ensure that data sharing aligns with funder expectations and disciplinary norms, which strengthens reuse and recognition.

**Biological Sciences:**
- **GenBank** - DNA/protein sequences (NCBI) ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/))
- **Protein Data Bank** - 3D protein structures ([https://www.rcsb.org/](https://www.rcsb.org/))

### 1.5 Software Repositories

Software repositories provide the infrastructure for developing, sharing, and sustaining research code. They make collaboration practical by tracking changes, enabling review, and preserving project history so others can verify, reuse, and build on your work. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab are central to this ecosystem because they pair Git version control with collaboration features (issues, pull/merge requests, CI/CD, documentation hosting) that help research teams work transparently and reproducibly.

| Feature | GitHub | GitLab |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary strength** | Large open-source community and discovery | Integrated DevOps and strong self-hosting options |
| **Hosting options** | Cloud-hosted (GitHub.com), enterprise options | Cloud-hosted (GitLab.com) and robust self-hosted | 
| **Collaboration** | Pull requests, issues, discussions | Merge requests, issues, epics |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions (marketplace-driven) | Built-in CI/CD with runners |
| **Privacy controls** | Private repos and org controls | Stronger enterprise privacy and on-prem controls |
| **Best fit** | Open-source visibility and broad community | Institutions needing self-hosting or integrated pipelines |

**Package Registries:**

Package registries are centralized catalogs that host, index, and distribute reusable software packages. They make it easy for researchers to share code with consistent versioning, dependencies, and documentation, and they allow others to install and update packages reliably using standard tools (for example, `pip` for Python or `install.packages()` for R). In practice, registries act as the publication layer for research software, enabling discoverability, citation, and long-term reuse.

**PyPI** (pypi.org) - Python
- 500,000+ packages
- `pip install` command standard
- Peer review through community
- Documentation hosting

**CRAN** (cran.r-project.org) - R
- 20,000+ packages
- Automated testing
- Vignettes and documentation
- Strong quality standards

**Zenodo and Software:**
- Direct software upload
- Automatic DOI for released versions
- GitHub-Zenodo integration (auto-archive releases)
- Preservation timeline: 20+ years

### 1.6 Choosing the Right Repository

**Decision Matrix:**

| Need | Best Choice | Rationale |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Active code development | GitHub/GitLab | Full version control |
| Final dataset archival | Zenodo/Figshare | Long-term preservation |
| Discipline-specific data | Domain repository | Specialized standards |
| Institutional requirement | Institutional repo | Policy compliance |
| Visual supplementary materials | Figshare | Rich media support |
| Python package distribution | PyPI | Standard ecosystem |
| Project coordination | Open Science Framework | Workflow integration |

### Summary

Repositories are foundational tools for open science:
- **Development repositories** (GitHub) support collaboration
- **Data repositories** (Zenodo, Figshare) enable archival and discovery
- **Discipline-specific repositories** follow community standards
- **Software registries** (PyPI, CRAN) distribute packages
- Combine multiple repositories for maximum effectiveness

#### Activities for Lesson 1

Complete at least two of the following activities to apply repository concepts:

**Activity 1.1: Repository Mapping**
Choose one of your current or planned projects and map where each output should live (code, raw data, cleaned data, figures, manuscript, preregistration). Identify the specific repository or platform for each output and explain why it fits.

**Activity 1.2: Development vs. Archive Decision**
Select a research artifact (e.g., codebase, dataset). Decide what should stay in a development repository versus what should be archived, and draft a release plan that includes a version number and an archival repository with a DOI.

**Activity 1.3: Data Repository Shortlist**
Create a shortlist of three repositories for your field and compare them on scope, storage limits, metadata requirements, and long-term preservation. Write 150-200 words explaining which one you would choose and why.

**Activity 1.4: Repository Metadata Draft**
Draft a metadata record for a dataset you have or plan to produce. Include title, description, creators, keywords, license, and a short README outline.

## Lesson 2: Version Control and Collaboration

### Overview
In this lesson, you learn about version control systems that track changes to code and documentation, understand different approaches to version control, explore platforms that facilitate collaboration, and practice implementing version control in your research workflow.

### 2.1 What is Version Control?

Version control is a systematic way to track and manage changes to files such as code, documentation, and research outputs. Rather than relying on ad hoc file naming, it preserves a detailed history of edits so you can see who changed what, when, and why. This history also makes it easy to revert to earlier versions if something breaks or a result needs to be reproduced exactly.

Beyond tracking changes, version control enables multiple people to work in parallel and later merge their contributions into a coherent whole. That collaborative workflow is what makes modern research software development scalable and reliable. For researchers, version control supports reproducibility by pinning analyses to specific versions of code, improves accountability with clear attribution, and provides a robust backup strategy through distributed copies. It also makes experimentation safer, since you can try new ideas without risking the integrity of your main workflow.

### 2.2 Types of Version Control Systems

**Centralized Version Control**

**How it works:**
Centralized version control relies on a single central server that holds the full version history. Developers check out files to work locally and then commit their changes back to that central server.

**Examples:** Subversion (SVN), Perforce, CVS

**Advantages:**
- Simpler conceptual model
- Clear central authority
- Easier access control

**Disadvantages:**
- Server dependency (offline work limited)
- Network traffic for every operation
- Single point of failure

**Distributed Version Control**

**How it works:**
In a distributed model, every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history. Work can proceed locally, and changes are shared and merged between repositories when collaborators synchronize their work.

**Examples:** Git, Mercurial (Hg), Bazaar

**Advantages:**
- Works offline (full history available)
- Redundancy (copies are backups)
- Parallel workflows easier
- Performance (local operations fast)

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex learning curve
- Larger local storage (full history)
- More merge conflict scenarios

### 2.3 Git Fundamentals

**Key Concepts:**

**Commit:** Snapshot of files at a point in time
```
✓ Each commit has:
  - Unique ID (hash)
  - Author and date
  - Message describing changes
  - Record of what changed
```

**Branch:** Independent development line
```
main branch:  ●---●---●---●
                    |
dev branch:         ●---●---●
```

**Merge:** Combining branches
```
Before merge:       After merge:
main: ●---●---●     main: ●---●---●---●
          |              |       |
dev:  ●---●---●         ●---●---●
```

**Workflow Example (Researcher):**
1. Create analysis branch
2. Make commits as you develop
3. Test thoroughly on branch
4. Create pull request for review
5. Merge to main branch
6. Main branch always has working code

### 2.4 Collaboration Platforms

Collaboration platforms layer communication and project management tools on top of version control, making it easier for research teams to coordinate work, review changes, and document decisions. They provide shared issue trackers, code review workflows, automation, and documentation hosting so that contributions remain transparent and reproducible. Choosing the right platform depends on your team’s size, privacy requirements, and integration needs.

**GitHub** (github.com) - Dominant platform
- **Users:** 100+ million, especially in open source
- **Free tier:** Public repositories unlimited, private with limits
- **Features:**
  - Pull requests (code review)
  - Issues (discussion and bug tracking)
  - GitHub Actions (automation/CI)
  - GitHub Pages (documentation websites)
  - Discussions (community support)
- **Best for:** Open source, large teams, educational use

**GitLab** (gitlab.com) - Full-featured alternative
- **Users:** 30+ million, growing in enterprise
- **Free tier:** Generous for public and private
- **Features:**
  - All GitHub features
  - Self-hosting options available
  - Built-in runners for CI/CD
  - Stronger privacy controls

**Bitbucket** (bitbucket.org) - Atlassian ecosystem
- **Users:** Popular in enterprise, less in research
- **Features:**
  - Supports Git and Mercurial
  - Jira integration (project management)
  - Atlassian ecosystem integration
- **Best for:** Teams using Jira and other Atlassian tools

**Institutional Repositories:**
- GitLab Community Edition (self-hosted)
- Gitea (lightweight self-hosted)
- Gitlab Cloud Dedicated
- For privacy requirements and institutional control

### 2.5 Best Practices for Research

Best practices help research teams keep repositories organized, reviews efficient, and results reproducible. They standardize how projects are structured, how changes are documented, and how collaboration happens so that new contributors can onboard quickly and analyses can be traced over time.

**Repository Organization:**
```
my-research-project/
├── README.md              (project overview)
├── .gitignore             (files to exclude)
├── data/                  (raw data, not code)
├── code/                  (analysis scripts)
├── results/               (outputs, often generated)
├── manuscripts/           (papers)
├── docs/                  (documentation)
└── .github/
    └── workflows/         (automation)
```

**Commit Message Best Practices:**
```
✓ Good: "Add confidence intervals to figure 3 analysis"
✗ Bad: "update"

✓ Good: "Fix dimension mismatch in preprocessing (issue #42)"
✗ Bad: "debug"

✓ Good: "Replace old data cleaning code with new function"
✗ Bad: "cleanup"
```

**Collaboration Workflow:**
1. Create branch for new feature: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. Make small, focused commits
3. Push branch: `git push origin feature-name`
4. Create pull request with description
5. Request review from collaborators
6. Address feedback with additional commits
7. Merge to main after approval
8. Delete branch after merge

### Summary

Version control is essential for open science:
- **Distributed systems** (Git) enable offline work and redundancy
- **Platforms** (GitHub, GitLab) add collaboration features
- **Best practices** ensure code quality and reproducibility
- **Workflow discipline** prevents conflicts and maintains clarity
- **Version control + repositories** = complete research preservation

#### Activities for Lesson 2

Complete at least two of the following activities to practice version control:

**Activity 2.1: Initialize a Research Repository**
Create a new Git repository for a small research project. Add a README, a license, and a basic folder structure (data, code, docs, results). Make at least three commits with clear messages.

**Activity 2.2: Branch and Merge Practice**
Create a feature branch, make a change to a file, and merge it back into `main`. Write a short reflection on what you learned about branching and merging.

**Activity 2.3: .gitignore Audit**
Create or update a `.gitignore` file for your project. Explain why each ignored category (raw data, secrets, build artifacts) should not be tracked in Git.

**Activity 2.4: Collaboration Simulation**
Open an issue describing a small improvement, then create a pull/merge request that resolves it. Write a brief summary as if you were reviewing your own change.

## Lesson 3: Persistent Identifiers and Citation

### Overview
In this lesson, you learn about persistent identifiers that ensure your research outputs remain discoverable and citable over time. You explore different types of identifiers, understand how they work technically, and practice obtaining and using them in your research.

### 3.1 What is a Persistent Identifier?

A persistent identifier (PID) is a long-lasting reference to a digital resource that remains valid and points to the same content indefinitely, even if URLs or storage locations change. PIDs are important because URLs break (average: 1.6 per day on Wikipedia), institutions reorganize and move files, servers migrate, and research outputs need permanent references for long-term access and citation.

**Persistent ID Properties:**
1. **Permanence:** Reference valid indefinitely
2. **Uniqueness:** Identifies specific version/item
3. **Resolvability:** Directs to current location
4. **Universal:** Works across institutions/platforms
5. **Citable:** Standard format for citations

**Example Problem Solved by PIDs:**
```
Without PID:
Link: http://myuniversity.edu/research/data/study123
↓ (Months later)
My files moved → Link broken → Research unreachable

With PID (DOI):
DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1234567
↓ (Months later)
Files moved → DOI resolver updated → Still works
```

### 3.2 Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

**What is a DOI?**
- Most widely used PID in research
- Standardized by ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
- Managed globally by registration agencies

**Format:**
```
10.5281/zenodo.1234567
┬─ ┬──────────────────
│  └─ Suffix (unique identifier)
└─── Prefix (registration agency)
```

**Major DOI Registration Agencies:**

**CrossRef** (crossref.org) - Academic publishing
- Issues ~100 million DOIs annually
- Articles, conference proceedings, books
- Journal publishers primary users
- Resolves through doi.org

**DataCite** (datacite.org) - Research data
- Issues ~50 million DOIs annually
- Datasets, software, other research outputs
- Repositories: Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad
- Rich metadata support

**How DOI Resolution Works:**
```
1. You cite: doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1234567
2. User clicks/types the DOI
3. doi.org proxy resolves to current URL
4. User reaches content (wherever it is now)
```

**Obtaining DOIs:**

For published articles, the publisher typically issues the DOI automatically once the work is accepted and published, and this is usually free for authors. For research data, DOIs are assigned when you deposit the dataset in a DataCite member repository; platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, and Dataverse issue DOIs automatically as part of their deposit or publication workflows. For software, DOIs are commonly minted through GitHub–Zenodo integration (which archives GitHub releases), or by uploading a release directly to Zenodo; package registries like PyPI and CRAN often complement DOI-based citation with structured metadata and versioning.

Regardless of output type, repositories require basic metadata to generate a DOI and make the record discoverable. At minimum this includes the title, creators/authors, publication date, and resource type (e.g., dataset, software, article), with a short description recommended to provide context for reuse.

### 3.3 ORCID: Researcher Identifier

**What is ORCID?** ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is a unique 16-digit identifier for researchers that links your publications, datasets, and contributions across platforms. It is an international standard (ISO 27729) used to unambiguously associate scholarly work with its creators.

**ORCID Format:**
```
ORCID: 0000-0002-1825-0097
       │      │    │    │
       └──────┴────┴────┴─ Unique number
```

**Why Researchers Need ORCID:**

**Name Disambiguation:**
- "John Smith" appears 10,000+ times
- ORCID uniquely identifies you
- Works across languages and transliteration

**Comprehensive Profile:**
- All your publications in one place
- Datasets and software you've produced
- Grants and funding
- Affiliations and employment history
- Works across all databases

**Integration with Systems:**
- Funding agencies (NSF, NIH, EU)
- Repositories (Zenodo, Figshare)
- Journals (Nature, Science, eLife)
- University repositories
- Automated data import from CrossRef/DataCite

**Getting and Using ORCID:**
1. Create account at [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/) (free)
2. Add biographical information
3. Add publications and works (manual or auto-import)
4. Set privacy settings (public/limited/private)
5. Use ORCID in funding/publication submissions
6. Example: "Josephine Doe (ORCID: 0000-0002-1825-0097)"

ORCID profiles increase discoverability, improve tracking of research impact, and help funders recognize your contributions across outputs. They also provide a clear, portable career record that supports job and grant applications.

### 3.4 Other Persistent Identifier Types

**ARK (Archival Resource Key)**
- Emphasis on long-term preservation
- Especially for library and archive materials
- Example: ark:/13030/c7h0rt9s
- Used by: Internet Archive, libraries, archives
- Best for: Cultural heritage, manuscripts

**Handle System**
- Protocol and network for PID resolution
- Foundation that DOI system is built on
- More complex than DOI for end-users
- Used for: Large digital collections

**URLs with Preservation:**
- Institutional repositories often issue URLs
- Less stable than formal PIDs
- Solution: Use alongside DOI

**ISBN/ISSN (Publications)**
- ISBN: Books
- ISSN: Serial publications (journals, magazines)
- Limited to specific formats
- Important for: Citation of monographs and journals

### 3.5 Using Persistent Identifiers in Citations

**Citation Format Examples:**

**Dataset with DOI:**
```
Author, A. (2024). Title of dataset (Version 1.0.0) 
[Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1234567
```

**Software with DOI:**
```
Author, A. (2024). Software name (v2.1.0). Zenodo. 
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1234567
```

**Journal Article:**
```
Smith, J., Jones, B., & Brown, C. (2024). Title. 
Journal Name, 15(3), 123-145. 
https://doi.org/10.1234/journal.2024.001234
```

**Including Author ORCID:**
```
Smith, J. (ORCID: 0000-0002-1825-0097), Jones, B. & Brown, C. 
(2024). Title. Journal Name, 15(3), 123-145.
```

**Automatic Citation Generation:**
- Most repositories provide citation in multiple formats
- Zenodo: BibTeX, JSON, DataCite, Dublin Core, RIS
- Figshare: Same formats
- Google Scholar: Bibtex, Abstract
- Copy-paste into bibliography

### 3.6 Best Practices with Persistent Identifiers

**For Research Data:**
- Deposit in a DOI-issuing repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad)
- Provide complete metadata and use the DataCite schema
- Include a data availability statement
- Cite datasets in publications

**For Software:**
- Create versioned releases and archive with Zenodo for DOIs
- Use semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0)
- Cite software per software citation principles

**For Yourself:**
- Create and maintain an ORCID profile
- Set appropriate privacy levels
- Link all research outputs and use ORCID in submissions

**In Publications:**
- Include data availability statements with DOIs
- Link to code repositories and software
- List contributor ORCIDs
- Use persistent links and cite supplementary materials

### Summary

Persistent identifiers are essential research infrastructure:
- **DOIs** ensure long-term access to research outputs
- **ORCIDs** uniquely identify researchers and their contributions
- **Proper use** enables discovery, citation tracking, and impact measurement
- **Best practices** maximize discoverability and credit attribution

#### Activities for Lesson 3

Complete at least two of the following activities to practice using persistent identifiers:

**Activity 3.1: ORCID Setup and Update**
Create or update your ORCID profile. Add at least one publication, dataset, or software entry and set appropriate visibility permissions.

**Activity 3.2: DOI Planning**
Choose a research output and draft a plan to mint a DOI (which repository, what metadata you will provide, and how you will cite it).

**Activity 3.3: Citation Practice**
Write citations for one dataset, one software package, and one paper using DOI-based formats. Note any differences in formatting across resource types.

**Activity 3.4: Identifier Inventory**
List the identifiers used in your lab or project (DOIs, ORCIDs, grant numbers). Identify one gap and propose how to fill it.
