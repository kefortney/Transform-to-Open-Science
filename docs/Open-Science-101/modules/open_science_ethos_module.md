### Lesson 1: What is Open Science?

#### Overview
In this lesson, you take a closer look at what open science means, including the intended goals and outcomes of adopting open science as an individual and as part of a larger community. You then review examples of open science in action. Finally, you wrap up the lesson by taking a closer look at why adopting open science is needed.

#### 1.1 Defining Open Science

**What Is Open Science?**

Open Science is the principle and practice of making the products and processes of research available to all members of an extended, diverse global community while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, fostering collaborations, enabling reproducibility, and advancing equity.

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Accessible** - Research freely available with no paywalls or barriers
2. **Transparent** - Methods documented, data available, decisions visible
3. **Collaborative** - Researchers work together, share resources, build on each other's work
4. **Inclusive** - Welcoming to all researchers, supports diversity, addresses inequities
5. **Accountable** - Clear authorship, disclosed conflicts of interest, errors corrected

#### 1.2 The "Use, Make, Share" Framework

**USE** - Building on Open Research: Utilize existing research to accelerate discovery and avoid duplication
**MAKE** - Conducting Open Research: Conduct research with transparent methods and reproducible practices
**SHARE** - Disseminating Research: Make research outputs freely available through open access publications and repositories

#### 1.3 Why Open Science Is Needed

The research community faces several interconnected challenges that open science helps address. A 2016 survey published in Nature revealed that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, highlighting a widespread reproducibility crisis ([Baker, 2016](bibliography.md)). This problem contributes to significant research waste—[Chalmers and Glasziou (2009)](bibliography.md) estimated that approximately 85% of biomedical research investments may be avoidable waste due to problems in how research is designed, conducted, and reported. Beyond inefficiency, the traditional publishing system creates equity barriers through paywalls that exclude researchers in low- and middle-income countries from accessing the latest findings, perpetuating global knowledge disparities. The speed of scientific discovery is further hampered by traditional publication timelines that can delay critical findings by months or even years between submission and publication. Finally, when research methods and data remain opaque, public trust in science erodes—a particular concern when scientific evidence must inform urgent policy decisions.

Open science practices directly address each of these challenges through concrete mechanisms. By making data and code publicly available, researchers enable independent verification of results, directly confronting the reproducibility crisis. Transparent documentation of methods allows others to understand, replicate, and build upon existing work with confidence. Open repositories and search infrastructure make research products easily discoverable, reducing redundant effort and accelerating scientific progress. Preprints and open access publishing enable rapid knowledge dissemination, shortening the months- or years-long delays inherent in traditional publication models. Perhaps most importantly, this transparency builds public trust in science by demonstrating that research can withstand scrutiny and that the scientific community is committed to accountability and continuous improvement.

#### 1.4 Benefits of Open Science

**For Individual Researchers:**

Adopting open science practices offers tangible professional advantages for researchers at all career stages. Studies consistently demonstrate that openly available research articles receive significantly more citations than paywalled equivalents, with some analyses showing citation advantages ranging from 3-10 times higher depending on the field. This increased visibility translates directly into enhanced professional reputation and career impact. Open practices also make your work more discoverable to potential collaborators across institutions and disciplines, facilitating networking and partnership opportunities that might not otherwise arise. Furthermore, by building on openly shared data, code, and methods from other researchers, you can accelerate your own research progress substantially, avoiding the need to recreate resources and learning from documented best practices.

- Increased citations (open work cited more frequently)
- Higher career impact and visibility
- Easier collaboration opportunities
- Building on others' work speeds research

**For Scientific Communities:**

The collective benefits of open science extend far beyond individual researchers to transform entire scientific communities and disciplines. When research outputs are openly available, communities can progress approximately 30% faster by building directly on existing work rather than duplicating efforts. The transparency inherent in open science enables better identification and correction of errors through broader community scrutiny, leading to higher overall research quality. This same transparency helps reduce the enormous research waste identified by Chalmers and Glasziou, as researchers can learn from both successes and failures documented in the literature. Perhaps most excitingly, open science facilitates cross-disciplinary innovation by making research accessible to scientists outside narrow specialty areas, enabling unexpected connections and breakthrough insights at disciplinary boundaries.

- Faster discovery through avoided duplication
- Quality improvement via scrutiny
- Reduced research waste
- Cross-disciplinary insights

**For Society:**

The societal benefits of open science are profound and far-reaching, extending well beyond academia into policy, public health, innovation, and global equity. When research is openly accessible, policymakers can make better-informed decisions based on comprehensive evidence rather than relying on limited or biased summaries. Open science also enables meaningful public engagement with research, helping citizens understand how scientific knowledge is created and increasing trust in evidence-based recommendations. The economic impact is substantial—open science facilitates innovation by allowing entrepreneurs, companies, and researchers to build on publicly available research, generating hundreds of billions of dollars in economic value. The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically illustrated the power of rapid open science: unprecedented global collaboration and open data sharing enabled vaccine development in under one year, a process that typically takes 10-15 years. Finally, open access ensures equitable participation in global science by removing paywalls that would otherwise exclude researchers and students in low- and middle-income countries from accessing cutting-edge knowledge.

- Better policy decisions based on evidence
- Public engagement with science
- Innovation and economic benefits
- Rapid response to emergencies
- Equitable global access

#### Summary

Open science is a fundamental shift toward making research more accessible, transparent, collaborative, reproducible, and equitable for all.

#### Lesson 1 Activity: Map Open Science to Your Research

**Objective:** Identify how open science principles apply to your own research or a research project you're familiar with.

**Instructions:**

1. **Select a research project:** Choose your current or recent research project, or one you know well.

2. **Map to the USE-MAKE-SHARE framework:** For your selected project, identify:
   - **USE:** What existing open research or data did you build upon? What additional open resources could have accelerated your work?
   - **MAKE:** Which aspects of your methodology are currently transparent? What documentation could be improved?
   - **SHARE:** How are you currently sharing your findings and data? What barriers prevent fuller sharing?

3. **Assess against open science characteristics:** Rate your project on a scale of 1-5 for each characteristic:
   - Accessible
   - Transparent
   - Collaborative
   - Inclusive
   - Accountable

4. **Reflect:** Write 2-3 sentences about which open science principle resonates most with your research goals, and which presents the greatest challenge.

**Deliverable:** A brief written reflection (150-200 words) on your research project's alignment with open science principles.

### Lesson 2: Why is Open Science Important?

#### Overview
In this lesson, you learn how adopting open science benefits you as a researcher and society. You also learn about some of the challenges and hurdles with using open science principles and how to navigate them.

#### 2.1 Career Benefits for Researchers

**Increased Impact and Visibility**

The citation advantage of open access is one of the most well-documented benefits for individual researchers. Multiple studies have found that open access articles receive substantially more citations than paywalled articles in the same journals, with citation advantages typically ranging from 18% to over 200% depending on the field and study methodology ([Piwowar et al., 2018](bibliography.md)). This increased visibility extends beyond traditional citations—open research is more discoverable through search engines like Google Scholar, reaches broader international audiences who might otherwise be excluded by paywalls, and enhances professional reputation by demonstrating commitment to transparent science and public engagement.

- Open papers receive significantly more citations
- Higher discoverability through search engines
- Broader readership reaches more people
- Enhanced professional reputation

**Funding and Collaboration Advantages**

Major research funders worldwide have increasingly mandated open science practices, making them essential rather than optional for funded research. The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) requires data management plans and data sharing for all funded projects. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented a comprehensive Data Management and Sharing Policy effective January 2023. The European Union's Horizon Europe program mandates open access to publications and FAIR data management. These policies mean that adopting open science practices is not just beneficial but often required for securing funding ([European Commission, 2021](bibliography.md)). Beyond compliance, openly sharing research makes your work more visible to potential collaborators worldwide, demonstrates research integrity and quality to reviewers and funders, and facilitates international partnerships that might not otherwise develop.

- Funders increasingly require open science (NSF, NIH, EU mandates)
- Visible research attracts collaborators
- Demonstrates research quality and integrity
- Opens international partnership opportunities

**Research Efficiency**

Perhaps the most tangible day-to-day benefit of open science is the acceleration of your own research through building on openly shared resources. When data, code, and detailed methods are openly available, you can avoid spending months recreating datasets or redeveloping analysis pipelines that already exist. Failed experiments and negative results, when openly documented, help you avoid repeating others' mistakes. Shared experimental protocols, reagents, and computational resources reduce costs and setup time. This efficiency compounds over time—researchers who regularly use open resources report substantial time savings that far outweigh the initial investment in learning open practices.

- Building on others' work accelerates your research
- Avoid redundant data collection
- Share experimental resources and costs
- Learn from documented failures and successes

#### 2.2 Benefits for Science and Society

While individual career benefits provide strong personal motivation for adopting open science, the collective impact on scientific communities and society at large is even more profound. Open science fundamentally transforms how knowledge is created, validated, and applied to solve real-world problems. By removing barriers to access and enabling transparent collaboration, open science accelerates the pace of discovery, improves research quality, and ensures that scientific advances benefit all of humanity rather than only those with institutional access to paywalled resources.

**Scientific Community Benefits:**

Research communities that embrace open science practices demonstrate measurably faster progress than those relying on traditional closed models. Studies estimate that open science fields advance approximately 30% faster because researchers can build directly on existing work without duplicating efforts or waiting months for publication ([Woelfle et al., 2011](bibliography.md)). The transparency inherent in open practices enables broader community scrutiny, leading to better identification and correction of errors before they become embedded in the literature. When data and methods are openly available, other researchers can verify reproducibility, test robustness across different contexts, and identify limitations that might not be apparent to the original authors. This collaborative error-correction mechanism substantially improves overall research quality. Furthermore, openly documented best practices and lessons learned—including negative results and failed approaches—help the entire community avoid repeating mistakes and adopt proven methodologies. Perhaps most exciting is how open science facilitates unexpected cross-disciplinary innovation by making specialized research accessible to scientists from other fields who might recognize novel applications or connections.

- Approximately 30% faster progress in open science fields
- Better identification and correction of errors through scrutiny
- Reproducibility verification and validation
- Best practices and lessons learned widely disseminated
- Cross-disciplinary innovation and unexpected discoveries

**Societal Benefits:**

The benefits of open science extend far beyond academia to transform how society addresses major challenges. When research evidence is openly accessible, policymakers can make better-informed decisions based on comprehensive evidence rather than relying on limited summaries or industry-funded studies. Open science also enables meaningful public engagement with research, helping citizens understand how scientific knowledge is created and fostering trust in evidence-based recommendations—particularly crucial during public health emergencies or environmental crises. The economic impact is substantial: estimates suggest that open access to publicly funded research generates hundreds of billions of dollars in economic value by enabling innovation, reducing barriers for entrepreneurs and small businesses, and avoiding duplicate expenditures ([European Commission, 2019](bibliography.md)). The COVID-19 pandemic provided a dramatic real-world demonstration of open science's power: unprecedented global collaboration, immediate preprint sharing, and open data enabled vaccine development in under one year rather than the typical 10-15 year timeline. Finally, open access ensures equitable global participation in science by removing paywalls that would otherwise exclude researchers, students, and practitioners in low- and middle-income countries from accessing cutting-edge knowledge.

- Evidence-based policy making with comprehensive access to research
- Rapid coordinated response to health and environmental emergencies
- Meaningful public engagement and trust in science
- Equitable global access removing economic barriers
- Hundreds of billions in economic value through enabled innovation

#### 2.3 Common Barriers and Solutions

**Fear-Based Barriers:**

**Fear of Being "Scooped"**

Many researchers worry that sharing their work openly before publication will allow competitors to steal their ideas or publish similar findings first. However, this fear is largely unfounded in practice. Preprints establish timestamped priority for your discoveries, unique insights and interpretations are always valued even if the core finding is similar, and experience shows that collaboration often produces better outcomes than competition.

**Solution:** Post preprints early to establish priority, embrace collaboration over competition, and recognize that your unique perspective adds value beyond the raw findings.

**Fear of Criticism**

Some researchers hesitate to share work openly because they fear public criticism or identification of errors. In reality, peer review already subjects your work to critique—open discussion simply makes this process more transparent and constructive. Open feedback typically improves research quality before formal publication, and being receptive to critique demonstrates confidence in your work rather than weakness.

**Solution:** Embrace open discussion as an opportunity to improve your work, focus on constructive feedback, and view transparency as a strength that builds trust in your research.

**Lack of Time**

Researchers often cite lack of time as a barrier to adopting open practices. While there is an initial learning curve—typically adding 15-20% effort to your first open science project—this investment pays dividends quickly. After 2-3 projects, most researchers report time savings as they build on openly available resources and reuse their own documentation infrastructure. The key is integrating open practices into your workflow from the start rather than treating them as an afterthought.

**Solution:** Document as you go rather than retroactively, use templates and automation tools to reduce repetitive work, and recognize that short-term investment yields long-term efficiency gains.

**Institutional Barriers:**

**Limited Support**

Many researchers lack institutional infrastructure for open science, including repositories, clear policies, and technical support staff. This absence of institutional support can make open science seem daunting or impossible. However, numerous free tools and platforms are available that require no institutional investment, and researchers can advocate for better resources while using these alternatives.

**Solution:** Use free repositories like GitHub, Zenodo, and Figshare; advocate for institutional resources by demonstrating demand; and partner with other institutions or researchers who have established infrastructure.

**Technical Skills Gaps**

Lack of familiarity with tools like Git, GitHub, data formats, or programming can feel like an insurmountable barrier to open science. Many researchers received no formal training in these computational tools during their education. Fortunately, the open science community has developed extensive free training resources, and you don't need to master everything at once.

**Solution:** Take advantage of free training resources like The Carpentries workshops, collaborate with colleagues who have complementary skills, and start with simple approaches before progressing to more complex practices.

**Cost of Open Access Publishing**

Article processing charges (APCs) for open access publication can range from $1,000 to $5,000 or more, creating a significant financial barrier, especially for researchers without grant funding or from institutions in lower-income countries. This cost structure seems to contradict the equity goals of open science. However, multiple pathways exist for making work openly accessible without paying high fees.

**Solution:** Use green open access by self-archiving in repositories after embargo periods, publish in diamond or platinum OA journals that charge no fees, request fee waivers from publishers (often available but underutilized), or leverage institutional or funder support for publication costs.

#### 2.4 Systemic Challenges

**Publication System Issues**

Academic culture has long equated research quality with publication in high-impact journals, many of which are not open access. This prestige journal culture creates tension with open science values—researchers face pressure to publish in selective journals that traditionally operate behind paywalls rather than in open access venues. The journal impact factor has been used as a proxy for research quality in hiring, promotion, and funding decisions, even though this metric has been widely criticized as inappropriate for evaluating individual researchers or papers.

**Solution:** Publish in high-quality open access journals that now exist across all disciplines (eLife, Nature Communications, PLOS journals), recognize that funders and institutions are increasingly shifting focus from impact factor to other quality indicators, and advocate for evaluation systems that assess research on its own merits rather than journal prestige.

**Publish-or-Perish Culture**

The academic incentive structure prioritizes publishing quickly and frequently over thoroughness, reproducibility, and openness. This pressure discourages researchers from taking the time needed to properly document methods, share data and code, or ensure reproducibility. Junior researchers especially feel compelled to prioritize quantity and speed over the additional work required for open science practices, fearing that transparency might slow their publication rate or reveal limitations in their work.

**Solution:** Use preprints to establish priority while taking time to ensure quality and openness, recognize that open practices are increasingly valued in hiring and promotion decisions, and support systemic changes to evaluation criteria that reward transparency, reproducibility, and collaborative practices alongside traditional publication metrics.

#### Summary

Open science offers substantial benefits for careers and society while most barriers can be overcome through planning, community support, and creative solutions.

#### Lesson 2 Activity: Personal Benefits and Barriers Assessment

**Objective:** Identify how open science benefits and barriers specifically apply to your research context and career stage.

**Instructions:**

1. **Create two columns** on paper or digitally:
   - **Column A: Benefits** - List the open science benefits most relevant to your career goals
   - **Column B: Barriers** - List the specific barriers you anticipate encountering

2. **Prioritize your benefits:** Rank your top 3 benefits by how impactful they could be for your career.

3. **Analyze your barriers:** For your top 3 barriers, identify:
   - Is this barrier personal, social/cultural, or institutional/infrastructure-based?
   - What resources or support could help overcome this barrier?
   - Who might you ask for help?

4. **Create action items:** For each of your top 3 barriers, write one concrete action you could take in the next 3 months to reduce that barrier.

**Deliverable:** A completed benefits/barriers assessment (1-2 pages) with prioritized barriers and concrete action items.

### Lesson 3: How to Do Open Science

#### Overview
This lesson introduces important security and privacy considerations for scientists when sharing information. Next, the lesson discusses how sharing information may impact different communities. Following this, the lesson explains the topic of intellectual property, how it can be protected, and the different types of licenses available to facilitate sharing while ensuring the owner of the information receives credit for their work. Lastly, this covers the effect of rules and regulations set by an organization, grant, or publisher on a scientist's options to make their research open access.

#### 3.1 Privacy and Security Considerations

**Why Privacy Matters**

While open science aims to make research as transparent and accessible as possible, this principle must be balanced against fundamental ethical obligations to protect research subjects and sensitive information. Research subject privacy is not merely a best practice but a legal and ethical requirement enforced through regulations like HIPAA in the United States and GDPR in Europe. Health information is particularly sensitive—containing details about diagnoses, treatments, genetic information, and other personal medical data that could cause harm if improperly disclosed. Vulnerable populations, including children, incarcerated individuals, people with cognitive impairments, and marginalized communities, require special protection due to power imbalances and heightened risks of exploitation or stigmatization. Beyond regulatory compliance, robust data security is essential to prevent unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse of sensitive information. These privacy and security considerations don't conflict with open science values—rather, they define the responsible boundaries within which openness must operate.

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
- Names, addresses, phone numbers, emails
- Birth dates, social security numbers
- Photographs, location data
- Health or genetic information

**Protecting Privacy While Staying Open:**

**De-identification Strategies:**
- Replace names with ID codes
- Report ranges instead of exact values
- Aggregate data to avoid individual identification
- Use synthetic datasets with same statistical properties

**Example:** Instead of "Patient name: Jane Smith, Age: 45, Condition: Depression," report "ID: SUB001, Age: 40-49, Condition: Mental health diagnosis"

**HIPAA Compliance (US Health Data):**
- Remove 18 specific identifiers
- De-identified data can be shared
- Aggregate statistics are safe
- Requires careful documentation

**Sensitive Data Categories:**
- **Security-related:** Infrastructure vulnerabilities, dangerous procedures
- **Proprietary:** Patent-pending discoveries, trade secrets
- **Location-based:** Endangered species locations, archaeological sites
- **Cultural:** Indigenous knowledge, sacred information

**Handling Sensitive Data:**
- Don't share publicly
- Use access agreements
- Delay publication for patents
- Obtain community consent for cultural knowledge
- Be transparent about restrictions

#### 3.2 Intellectual Property and Licensing

**What Is Intellectual Property?**

Intellectual property (IP) encompasses the legal rights that protect creations of the mind and provide creators with control over how their work is used. In research contexts, the most relevant forms of intellectual property include copyrights, which protect written works, software code, and databases; patents, which protect novel inventions and discoveries; trademarks, which protect brand names and identifying marks; and trade secrets, which protect confidential business information and proprietary methods. Understanding these different forms of IP is essential for researchers navigating the tension between protecting their work and sharing it openly.

**Copyright Issues in Research:**

Copyright law creates a significant barrier to open science because the default legal status of creative works—including research articles, datasets, and code—is "all rights reserved." This means that without explicit permission, readers legally cannot copy, modify, or reuse the work, even for educational or research purposes. This default restriction conflicts directly with the goals of open science. The solution is to use explicit open licenses that clearly communicate what others are permitted to do with your work. However, researchers must first clarify who actually owns the copyright: in many cases, it may belong to your institution, your funder, or the publisher rather than to you personally. Always check institutional policies and employment contracts before making licensing decisions.

**Patents and Open Science:**

Patents create an inherent tension with open science principles because they explicitly restrict who can access and use an invention, often for 20 years from the filing date. This restriction seems fundamentally at odds with the goal of making research freely available. However, patents serve an important purpose in the innovation ecosystem: they provide inventors with temporary exclusive rights that enable commercial development and return on investment, which can be necessary for translating research discoveries into real-world products and therapies. The pragmatic strategy for researchers who need to balance these concerns is to file patent applications before publishing research findings—once work is publicly disclosed, it typically cannot be patented. After the patent period expires (usually 20 years), the invention enters the public domain and becomes freely available to all. Being transparent about patent timelines and eventual public release can help maintain trust in your commitment to open science values.

**Licensing Your Work:**

Selecting the appropriate license for your research outputs is one of the most important decisions you'll make in practicing open science. For research data, the most open approach is CC0 (Creative Commons Zero), which places your work in the public domain with no restrictions whatsoever, allowing maximum reuse and integration into larger datasets. For academic writing and manuscripts, CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution) is the gold standard—it allows free use, modification, and redistribution as long as you receive credit for the original work. Software requires different licensing considerations: the MIT License is extremely popular because it's permissive with minimal restrictions, allowing both commercial and non-commercial use; Apache 2.0 offers similar permissions but adds explicit patent protection; and the GPL (General Public License) requires that any derivative works also remain open source, which can be important for ensuring long-term openness but may limit adoption.

**License Selection Guide:**

Choosing the right license depends on the type of content and your goals for sharing. For research data, use CC0 or CC BY to maximize reusability and enable integration into databases and meta-analyses. For academic writing including articles and reports, use CC BY to ensure you receive credit while enabling widespread dissemination. For software and code, consider MIT or Apache 2.0 for maximum adoption and flexibility, particularly if you want to enable commercial use. For educational resources and teaching materials, CC BY or CC BY-SA (ShareAlike, which requires derivative works to use the same license) help ensure these materials remain freely available to educators and learners worldwide.

**Core Principles of Open Source Licenses:**

Open source licenses share several fundamental principles that distinguish them from proprietary or "all rights reserved" approaches. First, they grant explicit permissions to use, study, modify, and distribute the work—rights that would otherwise be restricted by default copyright. Second, they often require attribution, ensuring that original creators receive credit even as their work is reused and adapted. Third, many incorporate share-alike or copyleft provisions that require derivative works to be released under the same open license, creating a protective mechanism that prevents open work from being incorporated into closed proprietary products. Fourth, open licenses are irrevocable—once you release work under an open license, you cannot retroactively restrict access to that version. Finally, these licenses are designed to be legally enforceable while remaining understandable to non-lawyers, using plain language wherever possible. Understanding these principles helps researchers make informed decisions about which license best serves their goals for sharing while protecting their interests and those of the broader research community.

#### 3.3 Funder and Institutional Constraints

**Deliverable:** A 1-2 page data sharing plan for your selected dataset.

### Lesson 4: When Not to Be Open

#### Overview
In this lesson, you will consider potential barriers to adopting open science practices. Barriers can come in the form of personal fears, as a result of misaligned social challenges, or institutional/infrastructure barriers. We discuss common barriers and mitigation strategies.

#### 4.1 Personal and Fear-Based Barriers

**Fear 1: "My work isn't good enough"**

Many researchers, especially early-career scientists, hesitate to share their work openly because they worry it isn't polished enough or may contain errors that will be judged harshly. This perfectionism is understandable but misplaced—the reality is that all research has limitations, and acknowledging these openly actually builds trust with the scientific community and demonstrates intellectual honesty. Transparency about your methods and assumptions allows others to understand the context and appropriate uses of your work, rather than leaving them to speculate. The best approach is to start small: choose one modest open science practice, implement it in your next project, seek feedback from trusted colleagues, and gradually build confidence as you experience the constructive responses that open science typically generates.

**Fear 2: "I will be scooped"**

The fear of being "scooped"—having competitors publish similar findings first—is one of the most commonly cited barriers to sharing work openly before formal publication. However, this fear is largely unfounded when examined against actual evidence. Preprints establish a clear, timestamped public record of priority for your discoveries, providing the same protection as traditional publication but much faster. Furthermore, simultaneous discoveries are actually quite common in science, reflecting the reality that multiple researchers are often working on similar problems using similar approaches—this is normal and even validates the importance of the finding. Historical analysis shows that most significant scientific findings are independently verified by multiple research groups, and the first to publish typically receives appropriate credit. Rather than hoarding work until formal publication, a more productive strategy is to post preprints early to establish your priority, then embrace collaboration rather than competition, recognizing that open discussion typically improves the work and accelerates progress for everyone involved.

**Fear 3: "I don't have time"**

Time constraints are real in academic research, and researchers legitimately worry that adopting open science practices will add to their already overwhelming workload. The honest answer is that there is an initial learning curve: your first open science project will likely require 15-20% additional effort as you learn new tools, establish workflows, and figure out documentation practices. However, this investment pays off quickly—by your second and third projects, the additional effort typically drops to just 5-10% as you reuse templates and documentation infrastructure you've already created. The long-term benefit is even more compelling: researchers who regularly build on openly available data, code, and methods report time savings of 30-40% compared to recreating everything from scratch. The key to minimizing the time burden is to integrate open practices into your workflow from the beginning—document your work as you go rather than trying to reconstruct everything retroactively, use templates and automation tools to reduce repetitive tasks, and plan for openness from your project's inception rather than treating it as an afterthought.

**Fear 4: "I'll be publicly shamed or attacked"**

Some researchers avoid sharing work openly because they fear public criticism, harsh judgment, or even personal attacks on social media or in online forums. While these concerns are understandable given occasional high-profile controversies, the reality is that the vast majority of open science interactions are constructive and professional. Most feedback on openly shared work focuses on improving methods, clarifying assumptions, or suggesting alternative interpretations—exactly the kind of peer input that strengthens research before formal publication. Personal attacks are rare and typically come from the same small number of individuals who would likely critique your work regardless of how it's shared. The most effective strategy is to approach open sharing with the right mindset: focus on substantive feedback that can improve your work, recognize that constructive criticism is a gift rather than an attack, ignore the rare trolls who contribute nothing valuable, and actively build relationships within supportive open science communities where respectful discourse is the norm.

#### 4.2 Social and Cultural Barriers

**Skepticism from Peers**

One of the more subtle but pervasive barriers to adopting open science comes from colleagues who view these practices with skepticism or even dismissiveness. You may encounter peers who think open science is naive, unnecessarily risky, or a waste of time that distracts from "real" research productivity. This skepticism often stems from unfamiliarity with open practices or past negative experiences in a more competitive research environment. Changing minds requires patience and evidence rather than confrontation. The most effective approach is to share concrete evidence of open science benefits—citation advantages, collaboration opportunities, funding compliance—while leading by example through your own successful adoption of open practices. Focus on building alliances with like-minded colleagues rather than trying to convert everyone immediately, and recognize that institutional culture shifts gradually as more researchers demonstrate tangible benefits.

**Publish-or-Perish Culture**

The intense pressure to publish frequently and quickly creates a powerful disincentive for open science practices, as researchers fear that transparency and thoroughness will slow their publication rate and harm their careers. This publish-or-perish culture prioritizes quantity and speed over the quality, reproducibility, and openness that strengthen science in the long term. However, the landscape is shifting: preprints now establish priority just as effectively as traditional publications but with far faster timelines, and open practices are increasingly valued in hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions as institutions recognize their importance. Rather than viewing openness as incompatible with career advancement, researchers can leverage preprints to secure priority while taking the time to ensure their work is thorough and well-documented.

**Prestige Journal Bias**

Academic culture has long associated research quality with publication in prestigious high-impact journals, many of which have traditionally operated behind paywalls rather than as open access venues. This creates a difficult choice for researchers who want to practice open science but also need publications in journals that carry weight in hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. However, this landscape has changed dramatically in recent years. High-quality open access journals now exist across virtually all disciplines—including eLife, Nature Communications, and the PLOS family of journals—that carry significant prestige and impact. Furthermore, major funders and progressive institutions are increasingly shifting their focus away from journal impact factors toward more meaningful indicators of research quality and impact. Researchers can help accelerate this transition by choosing to publish in high-quality open access venues and advocating for evaluation systems that assess research on its own merits rather than relying on journal prestige as a proxy.

#### 4.3 Institutional and Infrastructure Barriers

**Limited Support**

Many researchers find themselves at institutions that lack the infrastructure to support open science effectively. Without institutional repositories for data and code, clear policies about copyright and data sharing, or dedicated technical support staff to help with implementation, open science can feel daunting or even impossible. This absence of institutional support represents a genuine structural barrier rather than just a personal obstacle. However, researchers are not helpless in this situation. Numerous free tools and platforms require no institutional investment—GitHub provides free code repositories, while Zenodo and Figshare offer free data archiving with DOIs. By using these freely available resources, researchers can practice open science independently while simultaneously advocating for better institutional infrastructure. Demonstrating demand through your own usage helps make the case for institutional investment, and partnering with researchers at other institutions who have established infrastructure can provide access to resources and expertise your own institution may lack.

**Technical Skills Gaps**

Lack of technical skills represents one of the most commonly cited barriers to open science adoption. Many researchers, particularly those trained before computational methods became central to their fields, feel intimidated by tools like Git, GitHub, programming languages, or specialized data formats. This skills gap is understandable—most traditional research training programs provide little to no instruction in these computational tools, leaving researchers to feel they're expected to learn complex technical systems on top of their already demanding research responsibilities. Fortunately, the open science community has developed extensive free training resources specifically designed for researchers without technical backgrounds. Organizations like The Carpentries offer workshops worldwide that teach foundational data and coding skills in a supportive, research-focused environment. Rather than trying to master everything at once, researchers can start with simple approaches—basic file organization, simple documentation practices, straightforward version control—and gradually build skills over time. Collaborating with colleagues who have complementary technical skills can also bridge gaps while providing learning opportunities.

**Time and Cost Constraints**

The practical realities of limited time and financial resources create genuine barriers to open science adoption. Open science does require additional effort, particularly when first learning new practices and tools, and this investment of time comes from researchers who are already overwhelmed with teaching, grant writing, committee work, and research deadlines. The financial barrier is equally real: article processing charges for open access publication can range from $1,000 to $5,000 or more per article, representing a significant expense that not all researchers can afford, particularly those without grant funding or at institutions in lower-income countries. However, strategic approaches can minimize both time and financial barriers. Planning for openness from the start of a project rather than retrofitting it later reduces time investment substantially. Using templates, automation tools, and established workflows eliminates repetitive work. For publication costs, green open access—self-archiving manuscripts in institutional or disciplinary repositories after embargo periods—provides a completely free alternative to expensive article processing charges. Diamond or platinum open access journals charge no fees to either authors or readers. Many publishers offer fee waivers that are underutilized because researchers don't know to request them. Institutions and funders increasingly provide dedicated support for open access publication costs.

#### 4.4 Legitimate Reasons to Restrict Sharing

**Privacy and Security**

Certain types of research involve data that cannot and should not be shared openly, regardless of how committed you are to open science principles. Health data sometimes cannot be adequately de-identified without destroying its research utility—for example, genetic sequences or detailed medical histories combined with demographic information may allow re-identification even after standard anonymization procedures. Similarly, research subjects may not have consented to data sharing beyond the original study context, making broader sharing an ethical violation of their autonomy and trust. Security vulnerabilities represent another critical concern: research that identifies weaknesses in critical infrastructure, software systems, or security protocols could enable harm if disclosed publicly before fixes are implemented. In these situations, the appropriate strategy is to protect sensitive data while remaining as transparent as possible about your methods, analytical approaches, and findings. You can share aggregated results, synthetic datasets, or detailed methodological descriptions that allow others to understand and evaluate your work without exposing protected information.

**Intellectual Property**

Intellectual property considerations sometimes require temporarily restricting access to research findings, particularly when patent applications are pending or commercial development is planned. Patents require novelty—once research is publicly disclosed, it typically cannot be patented in most jurisdictions. For research that may have significant commercial applications, such as new therapeutic compounds, medical devices, or technological innovations, securing patent protection before publication may be necessary to enable the substantial investment required for development and regulatory approval. This temporary restriction on openness serves the ultimate goal of translating research discoveries into practical applications that benefit society. The appropriate strategy is to file patent applications before publishing research findings, then make the work openly available once IP protection is secured. Being transparent about your timeline for eventual disclosure helps maintain trust with the research community and demonstrates that the restriction is temporary and purposeful rather than indefinite hoarding of knowledge.

**Safety Concerns**

Certain research findings, if openly shared, could potentially be weaponized or misused in ways that create significant public safety risks. This includes research on dangerous pathogens, explosive or toxic materials, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, or critical infrastructure weaknesses. The concern is not theoretical—there are documented cases where openly published research has enabled harmful applications. However, this doesn't mean the research shouldn't be conducted or shared at all; rather, it requires thoughtful risk assessment and selective disclosure. The appropriate strategy is to consult with your institutional biosafety committee, research security office, or relevant oversight bodies to conduct a thorough risk-benefit analysis. Often, you can publish the non-sensitive portions of your research—your theoretical framework, general methodologies, and scientific conclusions—while restricting access to specific technical details that could enable misuse. Some research may warrant publication in venues with restricted access or sharing only among vetted researchers who have legitimate scientific need and appropriate security clearances.

**Cultural/Indigenous Knowledge**

Research involving Indigenous communities or cultural knowledge requires particular care regarding data sharing, as these communities often have legitimate claims to collective ownership of traditional knowledge, cultural practices, and information about sacred sites or resources. The history of extractive research practices—where researchers have taken knowledge from Indigenous communities without meaningful benefit or consultation—has created deep and justified mistrust. Western concepts of open science, which emphasize unrestricted sharing, can conflict with Indigenous principles of data sovereignty and community control over cultural information. Sacred or ceremonial information may not be appropriate for public disclosure regardless of scientific interest. The appropriate strategy, grounded in principles of research justice, is to obtain explicit community consent not just for conducting research but specifically for how data will be shared and used. Honor OCAP principles (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession) that recognize Indigenous communities' rights to govern the collection, protection, and use of their data. This may mean restricting data sharing, requiring community approval for publications, or implementing data governance agreements that give communities ongoing control over how their information is used. Open science in these contexts means transparency and accountability to the community first, rather than unrestricted public access.

#### 4.5 Graduated Openness Approach

**Not All-or-Nothing:**

1. **Restricted Access:** Data available to requesters via data use agreements
2. **Embargoed Release:** Data private initially, released after specified period
3. **Tiered Access:** De-identified data open; identifiable data restricted
4. **Progressive Opening:** Start closed, open over time as appropriate

**Timeline Example:**
```
Month 0-24: Collect data, keep private
Month 24: Publish, release deidentified data
Month 36: Release identified data to approved researchers
Month 48: Full public release
```

#### Summary

Barriers are real but manageable:
- Personal barriers: Start small, find community, reframe concerns
- Social barriers: Lead by example, educate, build allies
- Infrastructure barriers: Use free tools, seek training, collaborate
- Systemic barriers: Advocate for change, support alternatives
- Legitimate restrictions: Balance with transparency through graduated openness

#### Lesson 4 Activity: Develop Strategies to Overcome Your Barriers

**Objective:** Create specific, actionable strategies to address the barriers you identified in Lesson 2.

#### 5.2 Open Science Communities

**Why Join Communities:**

No researcher adopts open science in isolation—engaging with open science communities provides essential support, resources, and connections that make the journey both easier and more rewarding. Communities offer structured learning opportunities and skill development through workshops, webinars, and mentorship programs that can accelerate your mastery of new tools and practices. Perhaps equally important is the support and encouragement you'll find from others who understand the challenges you're facing and can offer practical advice based on their own experiences. These communities facilitate networking and collaboration, connecting you with potential research partners, co-authors, and colleagues across institutions and disciplines who share your commitment to openness. Members actively share resources—from code templates and documentation examples to lists of open access journals and data repositories—saving everyone time and effort. Finally, communities provide collective advocacy for systemic change, amplifying individual voices to influence institutional policies, funder requirements, and cultural norms in ways that individual researchers cannot achieve alone.

#### 5.6 The Future of Open Science

The open science landscape is undergoing fundamental transformation driven by converging forces—policy mandates, technological innovation, and cultural shifts in how scientific communities value transparency and collaboration. Policy and funder mandates are increasing globally at an accelerating pace. Major research funders worldwide, including the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the European Union's Horizon Europe program, now mandate or strongly incentivize open access and FAIR data practices ([European Commission, 2021](bibliography.md)). These mandates are not isolated to wealthy nations—funders in middle-income countries are increasingly adopting similar requirements, creating a global norm shift toward openness. This policy landscape means that open science is transitioning from optional "best practice" to institutional requirement and baseline expectation for funded research.

Perhaps more significantly, there is a genuine cultural shift underway in how the scientific community values openness. Early career researchers, who have grown up with digital tools and collaborative networks, increasingly expect open science as normal practice rather than exception. Open science is becoming expected within many research communities, with early career researchers more likely to practice openness than their senior colleagues. This generational transition will accelerate cultural change as these researchers move into leadership positions and shape institutional norms and hiring/promotion practices.

The traditional tension between open science and research prestige is also resolving in favor of openness. For decades, prestige and open access seemed incompatible—the most prestigious journals operated behind paywalls. This has fundamentally changed. High-impact open access journals now exist across all disciplines. Major funders are shifting their evaluation criteria away from journal impact factor toward more meaningful quality indicators like reproducibility, transparency, and actual research impact. Institutions are increasingly adopting evaluation systems that value open practices, data sharing, and collaborative contributions alongside traditional publication metrics. This realignment means researchers no longer face a stark choice between prestige and openness.

Finally, institutional support for open science is expanding worldwide. Universities, research institutes, and funding agencies are investing in infrastructure, training, and policies to support open science practices. Libraries are evolving from primarily collection-focused institutions to active partners in open science, providing repositories, consultation, and training. Funding bodies are creating dedicated positions and programs focused on open science. This institutional support removes structural barriers that previously made open science adoption difficult for researchers without personal technical expertise or resources.

**Your Role in Shaping the Future:**

While these systemic changes are encouraging, they are not inevitable or automatic—they depend on individual researchers like you choosing to adopt open science practices and advocate for change. Your decision to adopt practices now, even in small ways, contributes to the cultural shift toward openness. Support your colleagues in their open science journeys through mentorship, collaboration, and patient example rather than criticism. Advocate for change in your own institutional context by proposing policies, requesting resources, and highlighting successes. Build equitable research culture by ensuring that open science practices are inclusive and accessible to researchers at all career stages and from all backgrounds. Finally, recognize that you are shaping the future of research through your daily choices—each dataset shared, each code repository created, each methodology documented openly contributes to the irreversible transition toward open science as the standard model for research excellence.
